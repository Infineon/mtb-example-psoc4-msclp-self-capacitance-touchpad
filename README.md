# PSoC&trade; 4: MSCLP self-capacitance touchpad tuning

This code example demonstrates how to use the CAPSENSE&trade; middleware to detect a finger touch position on a self-capacitance-based touchpad widget in PSoC&trade; 4000T device with multi-sense converter low power (MSCLP).

In addition, this code example also explains how to manually tune the self-capacitance-based touchpad for optimum performance with respect to parameters such as reliability, power consumption, response time, and linearity using the CSD-RM sensing technique and CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner. Here, CAPSENSE&trade; Sigma Delta (CSD) represents the self-capacitance sensing technique and RM represents the ratiometric method.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator â€“ Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries must be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command-line tool(*project-creator-cli*). The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command-line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[PSoC&trade; 4: MSCLP self-capacitance touchpad tuning](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-self-capacitance-touchpad)" application with the desired name "MSCLPSelfCapTouchpadTuning" configured for the *CY8CKIT-040T* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-040T --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-self-capacitance-touchpad --user-app-name MSCLPSelfCapTouchpadTuning --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal by using the `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool (library-manager-cli) to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the CY8CKIT-040T BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the application:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MSCLPSelfCapTouchpadTuning" --add-bsp-name CY8CKIT-040T --add-bsp-version "latest-v3.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MSCLPSelfCapTouchpadTuning" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CKIT-040T
   ```

3. After programming, the application starts automatically.

4. To test the application, slide your finger over the CAPSENSE&trade; touchpad and notice that LED1 and LED3 turn ON with a green color when touched and turn OFF when the finger is lifted.

   - LED1 brightness increases when the finger is swiped from left to right.

   - LED3 brightness increases when the finger is swiped from bottom to top.

5. You can also monitor the CAPSENSE&trade; data using the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner application as follows:

    **Monitor data using CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

    1. Open CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner from the tools section in the IDE **Quick Panel**.

        You can also run the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner application in standalone mode from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-tuner*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config/* folder.

	     SeeÂ theÂ [ModusToolbox&trade;Â software userÂ guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide)Â {locallyÂ availableÂ atÂ *ModusToolbox&trade;Â installÂ directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf* forÂ optionsÂ toÂ openÂ theÂ CAPSENSE&trade;Â Tuner applicationÂ usingÂ theÂ CLI.

    2. Ensure the kit is in CMSIS-DAP bulk mode (KitProg3 status LED is ON and not blinking). See [Firmware-loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn how to update the firmware and switch modes in KitProg3.

    3. In the tuner application, click on the **Tuner Communication Setup** icon or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup**. In the window, select the I2C checkbox under KitProg3 and configure as follows:

         - **I2C address:** 8
         - **Sub-address:** 2-Bytes
         - **Speed (kHz):** 400

         These are the same values set in the EZI2C resource.

      **Figure 2. Tuner communication setup parameters**

      <img src="images/tuner-comm-setup.png" alt="Figure 2" width="600" />

6. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect** to establish a connection.

   <img src="images/tuner-connect.png" alt="Figure 3" width="400" />

7. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start** to start data streaming from the device.

   **Figure 4. Start tuner communication**

   <img src="images/tuner-start.png" alt="Figure 4" width="400" />

   The tuner displays the data from the sensor in the **Widget View**, **Graph View** and **Touchpad View** tabs.

8. Set **Read Mode** to **Synchronized**. Under the **Widget View** tab, you can see the **Touchpad_SELF_CAP** widget highlighted in **Blue** color when you touch it.

   **Figure 5. Widget view of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/widget-view.png" alt="Figure 5"/>

9. You can view the raw count, baseline, difference count, status for each sensor, and touchpad position in the **Graph View** tab. For example, to view the sensor data for Touchpad_SELF_CAP, select **Touchpad_SELF_CAP_Col0** under **Touchpad_SELF_CAP**.

   **Figure 6. Graph View tab of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/graph-view.png" alt="Figure 6"/>

10. The **Touchpad View** tab shows the heatmap view, and the finger movement can be visualized on the same.

      **Figure 7. Touchpad view of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

      <img src="images/touchpad-view.png" alt="Figure 7"/>

11. See the **Widget/Sensor Parameters** section in the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner window. The configuration parameters for each touchpad sensor element calculated by the CAPSENSE&trade; resource are displayed as shown in Figure 7.

12. Verify that the SNR is greater than 5:1 and the signal count is above 50 by following the steps given in [Stage 4: Obtain noise and crossover point](#stage-4-obtain-noise-and crossover-point).

Non-reporting of false touches and the linearity of the position graph indicate proper tuning.



## Tuning procedure

### Create custom BSP for your board

1. Create a custom BSP for your board with any device by following the steps given in [ModusToolboxâ„¢ BSP Assistant user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBSPAssistant). This code example was created for the device "CY8C4046LQI-T452".

2. Open the *design.modus* file from the *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config/* folder obtained in the previous step and enable CAPSENSE&trade; to get the *design.cycapsense* file. CAPSENSE&trade; configuration can then be started from scratch as explained below.

The following steps explain the tuning procedure.

**Note:** See the "Selecting CAPSENSE&trade; hardware parameters" section in the [PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) to learn about the considerations for selecting each parameter value.

**Figure 8. CSD touchpad widget tuning flow**

<img src="images/flowchart_for_tuning.png" alt="Figure 8" width="600" />

Do the following to tune the touchpad widget:

- [Stage 1: Set the initial hardware parameters](#stage-1-set-the-initial-hardware-parameters)

- [Stage 2: Measure Sensor Capacitance to set CDAC Dither](#stage-2-measure-sensor-capacitance-to-set-cdac-dither)

- [Stage 3: Set the Sense clock frequency](#stage-3-set-the-sense-clock-frequency)

- [Stage 4:  Obtain noise and crossover point](#stage-4-obtain-noise-and-crossover-point)

- [Stage 5: Fine-tune sensitivity to achieve 5:1 SNR](#stage-5-fine-tune-sensitivity-to-achieve-51-snr)

- [Stage 6: Tune threshold parameters](#stage-6-tune-threshold-parameters)



### Stage 1: Set the initial hardware parameters
------------

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Launch the Device Configurator tool.

   You can launch the Device Configurator in Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; from the **Tools** section in the IDE **Quick Panel** or in standalone mode from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/device-configurator/device-configurator*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.modus* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config/* folder.

3. In the [PSoC&trade; 4000T Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T), the touchpad pins are connected to CAPSENSE&trade; channel (MSCLP 0). Therefore, make sure that you enable CAPSENSE&trade; channel in the Device Configurator, as shown in Figure 9.

   **Figure 9. Enable MSCLP channel in the Device Configurator**

   <img src="images/device-configurator-channel.png" alt="Figure 9"/>

   Save the changes and close the window.

4. Launch the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator tool.

   You can launch the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator tool in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; from the CAPSENSE&trade; peripheral setting in the Device Configurator or directly from the **Tools** section in the IDE **Quick Panel**. You can also launch it in standalone mode from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-configurator*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config/* folder.

   See the [ModusToolbox&trade; CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator tool guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseConfig) for step-by-step instructions on how to configure and launch CAPSENSE&trade; in ModusToolbox&trade;.

5. In the **Basic** tab, note that a single touchpad, 'Touchpad_SELF_CAP' is configured with CSD RM (self-cap) Sensing Mode.

   **Figure 10. CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator - Basic tab**

   <img src="images/capsense_basictab.png" alt="Figure 10"/>

6. Do the following in the **General** tab under the **Advanced** tab:

   1. Select **CAPSENSE&trade; IMO clock frequency** as 46 MHz.

   2. Set **Modulator clock divider** to '1' to obtain the maximum available modulator clock frequency as recommended in the [PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://documentation.infineon.com/html/psoc6/epf1667481159393.html).

      **Note:** The modulator clock frequency can be set to 46,000 kHz after changing the CAPSENSE&trade; IMO clock frequency to 46 MHz, because the modulator clock is derived from the CAPSENSE&trade; IMO clock. In the **CAPSENSE&trade; IMO clock frequency** drop-down list, select **46 MHz**.

   3. **Number of init sub-conversions** is set based on the hint shown when you hover over the edit box. Retain the default value.

   4. It is recommended to **Enable IIR filter (first order)** and set the **IIR filter raw count coefficient** to '128' when the CIC2 filter is enabled. You can enable the filters later depending on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements in [Stage 5: Fine-tune sensitivity to achieve 5:1 SNR](#stage-5-fine-tune-sensitivity-to-achieve-51-snr).

      Filters are used to reduce the peak-to-peak noise. Using filters will result in a longer scan time.

   **Figure 11. CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator â€“ General settings**

   <img src="images/adv_general.png" alt="Figure 11"/>

   **Note:** Each tab has a **Restore Defaults** button to restore the parameters of that tab to their default values.

7. Go to the **CSD Settings** tab and make the following changes:

   - Set **Inactive sensor connection** as **Shield**.

      Inactive sensors connected to Shield provide better performance in terms of SNR and refresh rate (as the use of shield results in a reduction of sensor Cp) and can also be used if your design requires liquid tolerance.

   - Set **Shield mode** to **Active**.

      MSCLP provides active and passive shielding. Active shielding is preferred for high-performance applications. Before enabling this option, ensure that your design has shield electrodes.

   - Set **Total shield count** as **3**.

      This is equal to the number of shield electrodes in your design. It is zero when only the inactive sensors are shielded.

   - Select **Enable CDAC auto-calibration** and **Enable compensation CDAC**.

      This helps in achieving the required CDAC calibration levels (85% of the maximum count) for all sensors in the widget while maintaining the same sensitivity across the sensor elements.

   - Select **Enable CDAC dither**.

      This helps in removing flat-spots by adding white noise that moves the conversion point around the flat-spot region.

   **Figure 12. CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator â€“ Advanced CSD settings**

   <img src="images/csd_advanced.png" alt="Figure 12"/>

8. Go to the **Widget Details** tab. Select **Touchpad_SELF_CAP** from the left pane, and then set the following:

   1. **Maximum X-Axis position** and **Maximum Y-Axis position**:Set to 255.

   2. **Column sense clock divider:** Retain the default value (will be set in [Stage 3: Set the sense clock frequency](#stage-3-set-the-sense-clock-frequency)).

   3. **Row sense clock divider:** Retain the default value (will be set in [Stage 3: Set the sense clock frequency](#stage-3-set-the-sense-clock-frequency)).

   4. **Clock source:** **Direct**

      **Note:** Spread Spectrum Clock (SSC) or PRS clock can be used as a clock source to deal with EMI/EMC issues.

   5. **Number of sub-conversions:** 12

     12 is an appropriate starting point to ensure a fast scan time and sufficient signal. This value will be adjusted as required in [Stage 5: Fine-tune sensitivity to achieve 5:1 SNR](#stage-5-fine-tune-sensitivity-to-achieve-51-snr).

   6. **Finger threshold:** 20

     Finger threshold is initially set to a low value, which allows the *Touchpad View* to track the finger movement during tuning.

   7. **Noise threshold:** 10

   8. **Negative noise threshold:** 10

   9. **Hysteresis:** 5

     These values reduce the influence of the baseline on the sensor signal, which helps to get the true difference count. Retain the default values for all other threshold parameters; these parameters are set in [Stage 6: Tune threshold parameters](#stage-6-tune-threshold-parameters).

   **Figure 13. CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator - Widget details settings**

   <img src="images/adv_widget_detail.png" alt="Figure 13" width="" />

9. Go to the **Scan Configuration** tab to select the pins and the scan slots. Do the following:

   **Figure 14. Scan Configuration tab**

   <img src="images/scan-configuration.png" alt="Figure 14"/>

   1. Configure pins for the electrodes using the drop-down menu.

   2. Configure the scan slots using **Auto-assign Slots** option.

      The summary section in the **Scan configuration** tab shows nine scan slots (for nine sensors). Each sensor is allotted a scan slot based on the slot number.

   3. Check the notice list for warnings or errors.

      **Note:** Enable the **Notice List** from the **View** menu if the notice list is not visible.

10. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

### Stage 2: Measure sensor capacitance to set CDAC Dither
------------

The CAPSENSE&trade; middleware provide Built In Self Test (BIST) API's to measure the capacitances of sensors configured in the application. The sensor capacitances are referred to as  **C<sub>p</sub>** for CSD sensors and **C<sub>m</sub>** for CSX sensor.

The steps to measure the C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>m</sub> using BIST are as follows.

   1.	Open CAPSENSEâ„¢ Configurator from **Quick Panel** and enable BIST library.

   **Figure 15. Enabling self test library**

   <img src="images/bist_measurement.png" alt="Figure 280" width=700>

   2.	Get the capacitance(C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>m</sub>) by following these steps:
        - Add breakpoint at the function call "measure_sensor_capacitance()" function in main.c
        - Run the application in debug mode
        - Click **Step over** button once break point hits
        - Add array variable sensor_capacitance to **Expressions view** tab, which holds the measured Cp values of sensors configured

   **Figure 16. Measure C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>m</sub> using BIST**

   <img src="images/debug-cp-measure.png" alt="Figure 280" width=700/>
   
   3.	The index of the sensor_capacitance array matches the sensor configuration in CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator, as shown in Figure 17.

   **Figure 17. Cp array index alignment**

   <img src="images/cp_alignment.png" alt="Figure 28" width=700/>

   

   4. Refer to [CAPSENSEâ„¢ library and documents](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense)  for more details about BIST.
   5. Keep this feature disabled in CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator, if not used in application.

### **CDAC Dither scale setting**

MSCLP uses CDAC dithering to reduce flat spots. Select the optimal dither scale parameter based on the sensor capacitance measured using BIST library.

See the following table for general recommended values of Dither scale.

**Table 1. Dither scale recommendation for CSD sensors**
 
Parasitic capacitance (C<sub>p</sub>) | Scale
:---: | :---:  
2pF <= C<sub>p</sub> < 3pF | 3
3pF <= C<sub>p</sub> < 5pF | 2
5pF <= C<sub>p</sub> < 10pF | 1
 C<sub>p</sub> >= 10pF  | 0

<br>

**Table 2. Dither Scale recommendation for CSX sensors**
 
Mutual capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) | Scale
:---: | :---:  
300fF <= C<sub>m</sub> < 500fF | 5
500fF <= C<sub>m</sub> < 1000fF | 4
1000fF <= C<sub>m</sub> < 2000fF | 3
C<sub>m</sub> >= 2pF  | Follow [Table 1](#Table-1.-Dither-Scale-Recommendation-for-CSD-Sensors)

 Set the scale value in CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator as follows.

**Figure 18. CDAC Dither scale setting**

   <img src="images/dither-scale-value.png" alt="Figure 18" width=800/>


### Stage 3: Set the sense clock frequency
-----------------

The sense clock is derived from the modulator clock using a clock-divider and is used to scan the sensor by driving the CAPSENSE&trade; switched capacitor circuits. Both the clock source and clock divider are configurable. The sense clock divider should be configured such that the pulse width of the sense clock is long enough to allow the sensor capacitance to charge and discharge completely. This is verified by observing the charging and discharging waveforms of the sensor using an oscilloscope and an active probe. The sensors should be probed close to the electrode and not at the sense pins or the series resistor. 

Refer to [Figure 19](#figure-19-proper-charge-cycle-of-a-sensor) and [Figure 20](#figure-20-improper-charge-cycle-of-a-sensor) for waveforms observed on the shield. [Figure 19](#figure-19-proper-charge-cycle-of-a-sensor) shows proper charging when the sense clock frequency is correctly tuned. The pulse width is at least 5 Tau, i.e., the voltage is reaching at least 99.3% of the required voltage at the end of each phase. [Figure 20](#figure-20-improper-charge-cycle-of-a-sensor) shows incomplete settling (charging/discharging).

<img src="images/csdrm-waveform-improper.png" alt="Figure 20" width="600"/>

1. Program the board and launch CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner.

2. See the charging waveform of the sensor as described earlier. 

3. If the charging is incomplete, increase the sense clock divider. This can be done in CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner by selecting the Sensor and editing the sense clock divider parameter in the Widget/Sensor Parameters panel.

   **Note:** The sense clock divider should be **divisible by 4**. This ensures that all four scan phases have equal durations. 

   After editing the value, click the **Apply to Device** button and observe the waveform again. Repeat this until complete settling is observed.  
   
4. Click the Apply to Project button so that the configuration is saved to your project. 

   **Figure 21. Sense Clock Divider setting**

   <img src="images/sense_clock_divider_setting.png" alt="Figure 21" />
   

5. Repeat this process for all the sensors and the Shield. Each sensor may require a different sense clock divider value to charge/discharge completely. But all the sensors that are in the same scan slot need to have the same sense clock source, sense clock divider, and number of sub-conversions. Therefore, take the largest sense clock divider in a given scan slot and apply it to all the other sensors that share that slot.



### Stage 4: Obtain noise and crossover point 
---------------

1. Program the board.

2.  Launch the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner to monitor the CAPSENSE&trade; data and for CAPSENSE&trade; parameter tuning and SNR measurement.

   See the [CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseTune) for step-by-step instructions on how to launch and configure the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner in ModusToolbox&trade; software.


3. Capture the raw counts of each sensor element in the touchpad as shown in Figure 22 and verify that they are approximately (+/- 5%) equal to 85% of the MaxCount. See [AN234231 - Achieving lowest-power capacitive sensing with PSoC&trade; 4000T](https://www.infineon.com/AN234231) for the MaxCount equation.

   1. Go to the **Touchpad View** tab and change the **Display settings** as follows:

      - Display mode: Touch reporting

      - Data type: RawCount

      - Value type: Current

      - Number of samples: 1000

   **Figure 22. Raw counts obtained on the Touchpad View tab in the Tuner window**

   <img src="images/touchpad-view-rc.png" alt="Figure 22" />

4. Observe and note the peak-to-peak noise of each sensor element in the touchpad.

   1. From the **Widget Explorer** section, select the widget *Touchpad_SELF_CAP*.

   2. Go to the **Touchpad View** tab and change the **Display settings** as follows:

      - Display mode: Touch Reporting

      - Data type: RawCount

      - Value type: Max-Min

      - Number of samples: 1000

   **Figure 23. Noise obtained on the Touchpad View tab in the Tuner window**

   <img src="images/touchpad-view-noise.png" alt="Figure 23" />


      See the Row and Column having the highest raw counts without placing a finger (which gives the peak-to-peak noise). In the touchpad view.
   3. Capture the Accurate Noise by following the below steps: 

     a) Click on the highest value observed in the heatmap for Row.

     b) Click on **SNR Measurement** Tab.

     c) Click on **Acquire Noise**.

     d) Repeat the above steps for the column as well.

   |:----------|:-------------------------| :------|
   |CY8CKIT-040T   | 336 | 207 |

5. Observe the sensor signal in the **Graph View** tab in the **Sensor Signal** graph display.

   a) Select the columns in Widget Explorer as shown in Figure 26. 
   
   b) Firmly swipe the finger (6 mm) horizontally on the touchpad in the Least Touch Intensity (LTI) position.

   c) Note the lowest cross-over point observed under **Sensor Signal**.

   d) Repeat the above steps for Row by swiping the finger vertically on the touchpad in the Least Touch Intensity (LTI) position.

   **Note:** The LTI signal is measured at the farthest point (not at the last column/row) of the touchpad from the sensor pin connection, where the sensors have the worst case RC-time constant.

   |:----------|:-------------------------| :------|
   |CY8CKIT-040T   | 1900 | 1600 |
 

### Stage 5: Fine-tune sensitivity to achieve 5:1 SNR
------------------

The CAPSENSE&trade; system may be required to work reliably in adverse conditions, such as a noisy environment. The touchpad sensors need to be tuned with SNR > 5:1 to avoid triggering false touches and to make sure that all intended touches are registered in these adverse conditions.

**Note:** For gesture detection, it is recommended to have around 10:1 SNR.

1. Ensure that the LTI signal count is greater than 50 and meets at least 5:1 SNR (using Equation 1).

   In the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner window, increase the **Number of sub-conversions** (located in the **Widget/Sensor Parameters** section, under **Widget Hardware Parameters**) by 10 until you achieve at least 5:1 SNR.

   **Equation 1. SNR**

   ![Equation 1](images/snr-equation.png)

   Where,

   - LTI signal is the signal obtained as shown in **Figure 26 and Figure 27**

   - Pk-Pk noise is the peak-to-peak noise obtained as shown in **Figure 24 and Figure 25**

   SNR is measured for row sensors and column sensors separately, using **Equation 1**.

   Here, from earlier mentioned Figures,

   SNR of column sensors = 1600/207 = 7.7; SNR of row sensors = 1900/336 = 5.6.

2. Update the number of sub-conversions.

   1. Update the number of sub-conversions (Nsub) directly in the **Widget/Sensor parameters** tab of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner.

   2. [CY8CKIT-040T](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T) has an in-built CIC2 filter which increases the resolution for the same scan time. See [AN234231 - Achieving lowest-power capacitive sensing with PSoC&trade; 4000T](https://www.infineon.com/AN234231) for detailed information on the CIC2 filter.

   3. Current consumption is directly proportional to the number of sub-conversions; therefore, decrease the number of sub-conversions to achieve lower current consumption.

      **Note:** The number of sub-conversions should be greater than or equal to 14, and they should not be increased beyond a certain limit such that the raw count does not increase more than 2^16 (as it is a 16-bit counter).

   4. Calculate the decimation rate using **Equation 2**. Resolution increases with an increase in decimation rate; therefore, set the maximum decimation rate.

      **Equation 2. Decimation rate**

      ![Equation 2](images/decimation-equation.png)

3. After changing the **Number of sub-conversions**, click **Apply to Device** to send the setting to the device. The change is reflected in the graphs.

   **Note:** The **Apply to Device** option is enabled only when the **Number of sub-conversions** is changed.

**Note:** Decrease the IIR filter coefficient if 5:1 SNR is not being achieved even with maximum Nsub.


### Stage 6: Tune threshold parameters
---------------

After confirming that your design meets the timing parameters, and the SNR is greater than 5:1, set your threshold parameters.

**Note:** Thresholds are set based on the LTI position, because it is the least valid touch signal that can be obtained.

1. Set the recommended threshold values for the touchpad widget using the LTI signal value obtained in [Stage 5: Fine-tune sensitivity to achieve 5:1 SNR](#stage-5-fine-tune-sensitivity-to-achieve-51-snr).

   - **Finger threshold** â€“ 80% of the lower LTI signal (either Row or Column)

   - **Noise Threshold** â€“ Twice the highest noise or 40% of the lower LTI signal (whichever is greater)

   - **Negative Noise Threshold** â€“ Twice the highest noise or 40% of the lower LTI signal (whichever is greater)

   - **Hysteresis** â€“ 10% of the lower LTI signal

   - **ON Debounce** â€“ Default value of 10 (set to '1' for gesture detection)

   - **Low Baseline Reset** â€“ Default value of 30

   - **Velocity** â€“ Default value of 2500

     **Note:** The 'Velocity' parameter is not required for single finger detection.

   **Table 5 . Software tuning parameters obtained for [CY8CKIT-040T](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T**)

   |Parameter|	 [CY8CKIT-040T](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T)|
   |:--------|:------|
   |Number of sub-conversions	| 46	|
   |Decimation rate	| 255 |
   |Finger threshold 	| 1280 |
   |Noise threshold | 640 |
   |Negative noise threshold	| 640 |
   |Hysteresis	| 160 |
   |ON debounce	| 10 |
   |Low baseline reset	| 30|

<br>

### Apply the settings to the firmware

1. Click **Apply to Device** and **Apply to Project** in the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner window to apply the settings to the device and project, respectively. Close the tuner.

   **Figure 23. Apply to project**

   <img src="images/apply_to_project.png" alt="Figure 23" width="500" />

   The change is updated in the *design.cycapsense* file and reflected in the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

The project contains a touchpad widget configured in CSD-RM sensing mode. See the [Tuning procedure](#tuning-procedure) section for step-by-step instructions to configure the other settings of the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator.

The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; middleware](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense) (see ModusToolbox&trade; user guide for more details on selecting a middleware). See [AN85951 â€“ PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) for more details on CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage.

The [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) provides a GUI-based tuner application for debugging and tuning the CAPSENSE&trade; system. The CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner application works with EZI2C and UART communication interfaces. This project has an SCB block configured in EZI2C mode to establish communication with the onboard KitProg, which in turn enables reading the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data by the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner; see Figure 24.

The CAPSENSE&trade; data structure that contains the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data is exposed to the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner by setting up the I2C communication data buffer with the CAPSENSE&trade; data structure. This enables the tuner to access the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data for tuning and debugging CAPSENSE&trade;.

The successful tuning of the touchpad is indicated by the RGB LED in the Evaluation Kit; the LED1 brightness increases when the finger is swiped from left to right, and the LED3 brightness increases when the finger is swiped from bottom to top on the touchpad.

The MOSI pin of the SPI slave peripheral is used to transfer data to the three serially connected LEDs for controlling color, brightness, and ON or OFF operation. The three LEDs form a daisy-chain connection, and communication happens over the serial interface to create an RGB configuration. The LED accepts a 8-bit input code, with three bytes for red, green, and blue color, five bits for global brightness, and three blank '1' bits. See the [LED datasheet](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Everlight%20PDFs/12-23C_RSGHBHW-5V01_2C_Rev4_12-17-18.pdf) for more details.
